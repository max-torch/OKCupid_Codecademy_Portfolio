# Project Description
In this project, I work with data from [OKCupid](https://www.okcupid.com/), an online dating app. This dataset was provided to me by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) as part of their [Data Scientist Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-science)

A brief, non-data scientist friendly project view is provided as a slide show, Slides.slides.html The slideshow can be viewed online [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/max-torch/OKCupid_Codecademy_Portfolio/blob/main/Slides.slides.html#/)
