# Project Description
In this project, I work with data from [OKCupid](https://www.okcupid.com/), an online dating app. This dataset was provided to me by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) as part of their [Data Scientist Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-science)

This project is discussed on my Portfolio Website in three parts:
- [Exploring and Visualizing OKCupid Data](https://max-torch.github.io/2021/05/15/OKCupid.html)
- [Gender Classification with OKCupid Data](https://max-torch.github.io/2021/05/14/ml_revisited.html)
- [Dating Pools using K-Means Clustering](https://max-torch.github.io/2021/05/14/Clustering.html)
